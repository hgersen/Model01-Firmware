  * The first is in your keymap definitions. There, you'll use the syntax
  * `M(MACRO_NAME)` to mark a specific keymap position as triggering `MACRO_NAME`
  *
  * The second usage is in the 'switch' statement in the `macroAction` function.
  * That switch statement actually runs the code associated with a macro when
  * a macro key is pressed.
